# MLTWA

Rudimentary python-code for the application of Multiple Lapse Time Window Analysis (MLTWA) for the calculation of seismic attenuation.

With mltwa.py the data is imported and inverted, the output is done event-wise as an npz file. Lines 14 to 62 must be adjusted accordingly.

plot_grd.py is an example script for plotting the object function of an event over different frequencies and shows how the mltwa.py export can be further processed.
